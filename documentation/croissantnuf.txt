- decide how to handle unclosed quotes
- leaks
- structured error handling throughout the program andmaking sure no leaks if exitiong in the middle of the program
- norminette
- exit codes

- we have to handle syntax errors better(they also create memleaks!!) !: test these to comapre to bash: 
|
| echo oi
| |
| $
| >
>
>>
>>>
<
<<
echo hi <
cat    <| ls
echo hi | >
echo hi | > >>
echo hi | < |
echo hi |   |
echo hi |  "|"
Environment path
Environment path

Execute commands but this time without any path (ls, wc, awk and so forth).

Unset the $PATH and ensure commands are not working anymore.

Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2) and ensure that directories are checked in order from left to right.

- we have to fix the STD-ERR through our entire minishell, we are over halfway there!
- and ofcourse all correct exitcodes.
- here and there tiny memleaks

Here are the main issues and suggestions for improvement:

Export command handling:

Your minishell should distinguish between export VAR=value and export without arguments.
When export is used without arguments, it should display all environment variables (which your shell did, but at the wrong time).
When used with an argument like export PATH=/bin/ls, it should set the variable.


Variable expansion in export:

The $ before PATH in the export command should be treated as part of the variable name to export, not as a variable to expand.


PATH updating:

After a successful export PATH=... command, subsequent commands should use the new PATH.
