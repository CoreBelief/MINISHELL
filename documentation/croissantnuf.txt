- decide how to handle unclosed quotes
- handle different type of words (single q, double q, no q) in the same word
- norminette
- exit codes

- we have to handle syntax errors better(they also create memleaks!!) !: test these to comapre to bash: 
|
| echo oi
| |
| $
| >
>
>>
>>>
<
<<
echo hi <
cat    <| ls
echo hi | >
echo hi | > >>
echo hi | < |
echo hi |   |
echo hi |  "|"


- we have to fix the STD-ERR through our entire minishell, we are over halfway there!
- and ofcourse all correct exitcodes.
- here and there tiny memleaks
