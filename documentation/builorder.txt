Certainly! I'll break down the Minishell project into specific modules and suggest an order for implementing them. This modular approach will help you tackle the project step-by-step:

1. Basic Shell Structure
   - Main loop (prompt, read input, basic execution)
   - Signal handling setup
   - History initialization

2. Lexer/Tokenizer
   - Split input into tokens
   - Handle quotes (single and double)
   - Identify command separators (if implementing)

3. Parser
   - Organize tokens into commands and arguments
   - Identify redirections and pipes
   - Handle environment variable expansion

4. Command Execution
   - Path resolution for executables
   - Fork and execve implementation
   - Wait for child processes

5. Builtin Commands
   - echo
   - cd
   - pwd
   - export
   - unset
   - env
   - exit

6. Redirections
   - Input redirection (<)
   - Output redirection (>)
   - Append output redirection (>>)
   - Here-document (<<)

7. Pipes
   - Single pipe implementation
   - Multiple pipes handling

8. Environment Variable Handling
   - Environment variable expansion in arguments
   - $? special variable handling

9. Signal Handling
   - Ctrl-C (SIGINT)
   - Ctrl-D (EOF)
   - Ctrl-\ (SIGQUIT)

10. Error Handling and Cleanup
    - Comprehensive error checking
    - Memory leak prevention
    - Code cleanup and optimization

Suggested order of implementation:

1. Basic Shell Structure
2. Lexer/Tokenizer
3. Parser (basic version)
4. Command Execution (simple commands)
5. Builtin Commands
6. Environment Variable Handling
7. Parser (expand to handle redirections and pipes)
8. Redirections
9. Pipes
10. Signal Handling
11. Error Handling and Cleanup

This order allows you to have a working shell early in the development process, which you can then incrementally improve and expand. Start with simple command execution, then add features like builtins, environment variables, redirections, and pipes. Finally, refine the signal handling and focus on robust error handling and memory management.

For each module:
1. Design the module's structure and interfaces
2. Implement core functionality
3. Write tests for the module
4. Integrate with existing code
5. Refactor and optimize as needed

Remember to commit your changes frequently and test thoroughly as you progress. This approach will help you manage the complexity of the project and ensure you're making steady progress.
