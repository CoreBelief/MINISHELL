error handlin+ unset path etc handling

exit should be fully numerical, should  exit with exitcode 2 when alphanumerical

finalize signals
	- interrupting tasks with ctrl Z doesnt work yet

fix: Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2) and ensure that directories are checked in order from left to right.

fix: Execute commands that should not work like 'dsbksdgbksdghsd'. Ensure minishell doesn't crash and prints an error. print if command not found and exit w 127
do: Try to execute a long command with a ton of arguments.

	- input ends with | gives seg fault
		- should give bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|' if just | and should wait for next cmd if cmd |, ex. ls |
