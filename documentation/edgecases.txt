export append edgecase += (strjoin)
and export variable edgecases (ellen thinks its somethig w numbers)
export happens sometimes in child and sometimes in parent, needs to be fixed

rm dir in dir fix ( setting path if unknown, using loop to go dit up until path is found) (ask claudia)

error handlin+ unset path etc handling
	- shouldnt show env after unsetting PATH, but our does
	- should display error mesage and our doesnt

exit should be fully numerical, should  exit with exitcode 2 when alphanumerical

exit status
	- remove gloal for exit status
	- variable expansion $?
	- add specific exit codes everywhere

HEREDOC

minishellception (update levels++, $SHLVL)

fix: Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2) and ensure that directories are checked in order from left to right.

fix: Execute commands that should not work like 'dsbksdgbksdghsd'. Ensure minishell doesn't crash and prints an error. print if command not found and exit w 127
do: Try to execute a long command with a ton of arguments. added this bu needs rigurous testing


parser svp
	- input ends with | gives seg fault
		- should give bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|' if just | and should wait for next cmd if cmd |, ex. ls |
